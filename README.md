## Fake News Detection Project
```
Welcome to our exciting project to uncover the top 1,000 movies on IMDb! In this journey, we'll be using the Scrapy library to automatically extract this valuable information from IMDb. Let's go on an adventure together and explore many extraordinary stories stored in the world of cinema.
```

## Addition Information
```
I will provide a brief guide on how to take the IMDB_Movies folder diary data, clean it up in an .ipynb file (IPython Notebook), and save the results in the form of a CSV file called "top1000movies_imdb.csv". I have a similar menu and text:
- Step 1: Scrape Data from IMDb Website
  Create a Python or Jupyter Notebook file (with the .ipynb extension) to scrape IMDb diary data. And it can use libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to pull data from IMDb pages like movie titles, release years, ratings, and more.
- Step 2: Data Cleaning
  It's in an .ipynb file, and there are a lot of data files.
- Step 3: Saving Data into CSV File
```
